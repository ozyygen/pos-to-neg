Step 1: Understanding Property Disjointness
Prompt:
Property disjointness is a constraint ensuring that two or more properties cannot apply to the same pair of entities simultaneously. 
Provide an explanation of what does it mean for two properties to be disjoint?

Model's Response:

Step 2: Critique the Explanation
Prompt:
Review the draft explanation above. Provide critical feedback and suggestions for improvement, focusing on clarity, completeness, and whether it effectively explains the concept of property disjointness.
Model's Response:

Step 3: Refine the Explanation Based on Critique
Prompt: 
Using the critique provided, refine the draft explanation to make it clearer and more comprehensive. Ensure that the refined explanation accurately conveys what it means for two properties to be disjoint.

Step 4: Determining the Answer
Prompt:
From the analysis above, are <candidate-type-placeholder> and <rule-head-constant> disjoint properties? Respond with 'yes' if they are or 'no' if they are not. Your response must be one word only: either 'yes' or 'no.' Do not provide any additional explanation or context.
